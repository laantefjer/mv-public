To be able to increase backup retention, the company has bought a Data Domain deduplication appliance. After setting up the jobs to use it, the backup administrator observes an increase of resource consumption on the backup server. The proxy configuration has not been modified. What is causing the issue?;A- The backup appliance does not have enough resources to process the data., B- The SSL certificate on the backup appliance needs to be updated., C- The backup server has to fulfill the gateway role., D- The backup server needs additional resources to use a deduplication appliance.;C;N/A;actualtestdumps-vmce-v12-veeam-certified-engineer-v12-verified-questions-answers-by-long-22-07-2024-8qa.pdf;When integrating a Data Domain deduplication appliance with Veeam Backup & Replication, it is typically used as a backup repository. The backup server may need to take on the gateway role, especially if the Data Domain is integrated over NFS or CIFS. This means that the backup server will be responsible for processing the data flow between the Veeam proxies and the deduplication appliance. If the gateway server (backup server) is not well-resourced, this additional workload can cause an increase in resource consumption on the backup server. The appliance's resources and the SSL certificate are not related to increased resource consumption on the backup server, and simply needing additional resources for deduplication (D) is not specific enough without indicating the gateway role.
Veeam Backup & Replication is currently configured to keep backups for 14 days on a NAS repository. An engineer needs to enable GFS with 12 monthly and 5 yearly full backups to extend the retention for archival purposes but does not have enough space on the repository to store them. After adding the repository to Scale-Out-Backup Repository (SOBR) as Performance Tier, which option should the engineer choose to solve this issue?;A- Add an Object Storage as Capacity tier and set the policy to copy backups to object storage as soon as they are created, B- Add another NAS repository as Capacity tier and set the policy to move backups older than 14 days, C- Add an Object Storage as Archive tier and set the policy to move all GFS backups, D- Add an Object Storage as Capacity tier and set the policy to move backups older than 14 days;D;N/A;actualtestdumps-vmce-v12-veeam-certified-engineer-v12-verified-questions-answers-by-long-22-07-2024-8qa.pdf;To solve the space issue while enabling GFS retention, the engineer should add an Object Storage as a Capacity tier to the Scale-Out Backup Repository (SOBR) and set the policy to move backups that are older than 14 days. This approach allows for efficient use of local NAS storage for short-term retention and leverages object storage for long-term archival purposes.

What should the backup administrator report to the other coworker regarding the 3-2-1 backup strategy?;A- This will save costs with the Archive Tier in the SOBR., B- This needs the Hardened Immutable Repository added to the capacity tier., C- This only has 1 copy of the backup data., D- This meets the 3-2-1 best practices requirements.;C;N/A;certsdeals-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-dumps-by-lambert-15-04-2024-10qa.pdf;The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a best practice that suggests having three total copies of your data, two of which are local but on different devices or media, and one copy offsite. In the described scenario, although there is an offsite component (SOBR with AWS S3 Performance Tier), and a local hardened immutable repository, there is no indication of a second local copy on a different device or media. This means that there is only one local copy of the backup data and one offsite copy. Therefore, the setup does not meet the 3-2-1 best practices requirement, which would involve having at least one more local copy on different media or device.
A company's infrastructure includes a Fibre Channel SAN where the VMware VMs are located. The administrator wants to create a backup that minimizes the impact on the production environment. What proxy transport mode should be used?;A- Network, B- Guest interaction, C- Direct storage access, D- Virtual appliance;C;N/A;certsdeals-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-dumps-by-lambert-15-04-2024-10qa.pdf;For a VMware environment on a Fibre Channel SAN, the most efficient proxy transport mode to minimize impact on the production environment is Direct Storage Access.

A Veeam administrator is creating a protection group that needs to back up all servers for the accounting department using Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows. New accounting servers must be automatically added to the protection group. How is this accomplished?;A- Create an Active Directory based protection group targeted at an Active Directory security group., B- Install a configuration file on each of the accounting servers that adds it to the protection group., C- Create a protection group and set it to automatically scan every three hours for new servers., D- Create a protection group that reads a CSV file listing the accounting servers.;A;N/A;sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf;To ensure that all servers for the accounting department are backed up and any new servers added to the department are automatically included in the protection group, the best approach is to use an Active Directory (AD) based protection group. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Create an Active Directory based protection group targeted at an Active Directory security group. By leveraging an AD-based protection group, the Veeam administrator can specify an AD security group that encompasses all user accounts or computer accounts (in this case, servers) associated with the accounting department. As new servers are introduced and added to this AD security group, Veeam Backup & Replication will automatically detect these new members during its periodic rescan (which can be scheduled as per the administrator's preferences) and include them in the protection group. This method not only automates the inclusion of new servers into the backup routine but also simplifies the management of backup policies for dynamically changing environments such as the accounting department's server infrastructure.
An administrator is asked to change a backup copy job from periodic mode to immediate mode. How can this be accomplished?;A- Enable immediate in the backup copy job settings drop down., B- Right click on the job name and choose immediate., C- Copy the original backup copy job to a different folder and remap the job., D- Create a new backup copy job and delete the original job.;D;N/A;sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf;To change a backup copy job from periodic mode to immediate mode, the most straightforward approach is D: Create a new backup copy job and delete the original job. Veeam Backup & Replication does not directly allow changing the mode of an existing backup copy job from periodic to immediate within the job settings. Therefore, the recommended practice is to set up a new backup copy job with the desired settings, in this case, immediate mode, which starts copying backups as soon as they are created by the primary backup job. After the new backup copy job is configured and tested to confirm it meets the requirements, the original periodic mode job can be safely deleted. This ensures a seamless transition to the immediate mode operation without risking data protection consistency or coverage.
What is the purpose of a Cache Repository when adding the file share?;A- To walk the file shares and move data to the backup repository, B- To control how fast the backup proxy can read data from the source file share, C- To make sure backup retention is being managed correctly, D- To store temporary metadata and track all objects that have changed;D;N/A;sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf;The purpose of a Cache Repository when adding a file share in Veeam Backup & Replication is D: To store temporary metadata and track all objects that have changed. When Veeam Backup & Replication backs up data from file shares, it uses the Cache Repository to store metadata related to the files and directories on the share. This metadata includes information about file versions, change logs, and the structure of the file share, which is essential for efficient backup operations, incremental backups, and restore operations. The Cache Repository plays a crucial role in tracking changes between backup jobs, enabling Veeam to perform quick incremental backups by only processing the data that has changed since the last backup, thereby optimizing backup performance and reducing network and storage load.
An infrastructure with 50 VMs has a power outage. After the VMware cluster has booted up again, 10 large VMs are orphaned. However, all VM disk files are still on the datastores. What is the quickest way to bring back those VMs with the least possible data loss?;A- Remove the existing VM disk files from the datastore and perform Instant VM Recovery, B- Perform Instant VM Recovery with quick rollback with automatic Power On VM at the end., C- Perform Restore VM Files and only restore the VM configuration files., D- Use the 'Restore guest files' option to restore the VM configuration files.;C;N/A;sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf;In a situation where VMs are orphaned after a power outage but their disk files remain intact on the datastores, the most efficient way to restore these VMs with minimal data loss is C: Perform Restore VM Files and only restore the VM configuration files. This approach involves using Veeam Backup & Replication to restore only the necessary VMX files (for VMware) or equivalent configuration files for other hypervisors, which contain the settings and configuration of the VMs. Since the disk files are still present and intact on the datastores, restoring the configuration files allows the VMs to be re-registered with the hypervisor and brought back online quickly, without the need to transfer or restore the entire VM disk files, thus minimizing downtime and data loss.
A planned failover of three VMs has just completed successfully, starting the VMs at the disaster recovery location. What next actions are available for the failover plan?;A- Undo, Start, Edit, Delete, B- Undo, Start, Copy, Delete, C- Cancel. Start, Edit, Delete, D- Cancel, Start, Copy, Delete;A;N/A;sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf;After completing a planned failover for VMs to the disaster recovery site, the typical actions available in Veeam Backup & Replication for a failover plan are: Undo: This allows you to reverse the failover and return the VMs to the original location. Start: This would be used to initiate the failover plan if it needs to be executed again. Edit: This option permits modifications to the failover plan. Delete: This allows the removal of the failover plan if it is no longer needed. There are no options for Copy in the context of a failover plan, and the Cancel option is typically available before and during the failover process, not after completion.
A 3-node Microsoft SQL Always On cluster is running in a VMware environment. The RPOs are: * 1 day for the cluster nodes * 15 minutes for the log files How should the cluster be backed up?;A- Veeam Backup and Replication - Create a VMware backup job, include the 3 nodes of the cluster. Use Application-Aware Processing to back up the transaction logs every 15 minutes., B- Veeam Agent for Windows - Create a managed by server backup job for all 3 nodes. Use Application-Aware Processing to back up the database once a day., C- Veeam Agent for Windows - Create a managed by agent backup policy for all 3 nodes. Use a log shipping server to back up the transaction logs every 15 minutes., D- Veeam Enterprise Plug-in for Microsoft SQL - Install the Plug-in on each node in cluster. Use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to create the backups.;A;N/A;sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf;For backing up a 3-node Microsoft SQL Always On cluster running in a VMware environment with the specified Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs), the most suitable option is A: Veeam Backup and Replication - Create a VMware backup job, include the 3 nodes of the cluster. Use Application-Aware Processing to back up the transaction logs every 15 minutes. This approach allows for the entire SQL cluster nodes to be backed up as part of a regular VM backup job, which satisfies the 1-day RPO for the cluster nodes. The Application-Aware Processing feature of Veeam Backup & Replication ensures that the SQL databases are in a consistent state during backup. Moreover, this feature allows for the transaction logs to be backed up separately at a more frequent interval, in this case, every 15 minutes, meeting the 15-minute RPO requirement for the log files. This dual approach ensures comprehensive protection for both the SQL cluster nodes and the critical transaction logs, aligning with the specified RPOS.
A backup administrator is called in to review a new Veeam deployment created by a coworker. The backup administrator takes the following notes: * 12 backup jobs * 1 SOBR configured with AWS S3 Performance Tier * 1 Repository configured on Hardened Immutable Repository The administrator also notes that six jobs are configured to use the SOBR and six jobs are configured to use the Hardened Immutable Repository. What should the backup administrator report to the other coworker regarding the 3-2-1 backup strategy?;A- This will save costs with the Archive Tier in the SOBR., B- This needs the Hardened Immutable Repository added to the capacity tier., C- This only has 1 copy of the backup data., D- This meets the 3-2-1 best practices requirements.;C;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a best practice that suggests having three total copies of your data, two of which are local but on different devices or media, and one copy offsite. In the described scenario, although there is an offsite component (SOBR with AWS S3 Performance Tier), and a local hardened immutable repository, there is no indication of a second local copy on a different device or media. This means that there is only one local copy of the backup data and one offsite copy. Therefore, the setup does not meet the 3-2-1 best practices requirement, which would involve having at least one more local copy on different media or device.
What is the primary benefit of configuring replica mapping?;A- Compressed WAN traffic, B- Deduplicated WAN traffic, C- Reduced WAN traffic, D- Encrypted WAN traffic;C;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;The primary benefit of configuring replica mapping in Veeam Backup & Replication is C: Reduced WAN traffic. Replica mapping is a feature that allows an administrator to map an existing VM in the disaster recovery site to a replica job. This is particularly useful when the initial replication of a large VM has been performed by other means (such as shipping a hard drive with the VM data to the DR site) or if a replica VM already exists and needs to be re-synced with the source VM. By using replica mapping, Veeam can avoid transferring the entire VM over the WAN again and instead only synchronize the differences between the source VM and the existing replica. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the WAN, conserving bandwidth and speeding up the replication process. It's an efficient way to manage replicas, especially for large VMs or in environments with limited bandwidth.
Why is it recommended to have at least one backup proxy server in each site when defining a replica job?;A- The proxies allow replication automatic restart after failure., B- The proxies allow for no VM snapshots during transit., C- It allows deduplication during data transit across the WAN, D- The proxies allow automatic WAN acceleration., E- The proxies enable a stable connection for VM data transfer across sites., F- It allows for no VM snapshots;E;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;Having at least one backup proxy server in each site when defining a replica job is recommended because the backup proxy servers are responsible for data processing and transfer. Having proxies in both sites enables a stable connection for VM data transfer across sites, as they handle the data compression, deduplication, and transfer processes. This setup ensures that data is efficiently moved from one site to another, thereby making replication more resilient and reliable. Proxies do not automatically restart replication after failure (A), remove the need for VM snapshots during transit (B and F), or enable automatic WAN acceleration (D), although they can work in conjunction with WAN accelerators if configured to do so. They also don't directly deduplicate data during transit across the WAN (C), although they do compress and optimize it for transfer.
Why is it recommended to install Veeam ONE before Veeam Backup & Replication?;A- Veeam ONE stores the license file necessary for Veeam Backup & Replication., B- Veeam ONE can verify that the server meets the minimum requirements to install Veeam Backup & Replication., C- Veeam ONE is a prerequisite for Veeam Backup & Replication installation., D- Veeam ONE can potentially identify infrastructure issues prior to performing a backup.;D;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;It is recommended to install Veeam ONE before Veeam Backup & Replication because Veeam ONE can potentially identify infrastructure issues that might affect backup operations before they are performed. This proactive approach ensures that the environment is optimized for successful backup and replication tasks.

A customer wants to start an on-demand lab from backup files for several mission critical VMs. What SureBackup feature should be configured to identify the necessary VMs?;A- Application Group, B- Virtual Lab, C- Staged Restore, D- Secure Restore;A;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;When starting an on-demand lab from backup files for mission-critical VMs, the appropriate SureBackup feature to configure is A: Application Group. An Application Group in Veeam Backup & Replication is a predefined group of VMs that are started together in the SureBackup job. This feature is designed to ensure that interdependent VMs, such as those comprising a multi-tier application, are started in a sequence that respects their operational dependencies, allowing for comprehensive verification and testing. The Application Group can include the mission-critical VMs and any associated VMs required for the application environment to function correctly, ensuring that all components are available and interact as expected within the isolated on-demand lab environment. This setup facilitates effective testing or troubleshooting in a manner that closely mirrors the production environment without impacting live operations.
An engineer needs to make sure that a backup job includes both the virtual machine's disk files and the Microsoft SQL database transaction logs. Which backup feature in Veeam Backup and Replication should be used?;A- Guest file system indexing, B- Crash consistent mode, C- App consistent mode, D- Application-aware processing;D;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;To ensure that a backup job includes both the virtual machine's disk files and the Microsoft SQL database transaction logs, Application-aware processing should be used. This feature enables Veeam Backup & Replication to create transactionally consistent backups of VMs running VSS-aware applications like Microsoft SQL Server, ensuring that both the VM disks and the SQL transaction logs are properly backed up.

To be able to increase backup retention, the company has bought a Data Domain deduplication appliance. After setting up the jobs to use it, the backup administrator observes an increase of resource consumption on the backup server. The proxy configuration has not been modified. What is causing the issue?;A- The backup appliance does not have enough resources to process the data., B- The SSL certificate on the backup appliance needs to be updated., C- The backup server has to fulfill the gateway role., D- The backup server needs additional resources to use a deduplication appliance.;C;N/A;vceexamstest-vmce-v12-questions-by-harris-29-01-2024-8qa.pdf;When integrating a Data Domain deduplication appliance with Veeam Backup & Replication, it is typically used as a backup repository. The backup server may need to take on the gateway role, especially if the Data Domain is integrated over NFS or CIFS. This means that the backup server will be responsible for processing the data flow between the Veeam proxies and the deduplication appliance. If the gateway server (backup server) is not well-resourced, this additional workload can cause an increase in resource consumption on the backup server. The appliance's resources and the SSL certificate are not related to increased resource consumption on the backup server, and simply needing additional resources for deduplication (D) is not specific enough without indicating the gateway role.

Veeam Backup & Replication is currently configured to back up different workloads: Windows VMs on vSphere and Linux VMs on vSphere. A secondary copy of all the backups including transaction logs must be created. Which of the following backup copy job configurations is the simplest?;"A. A single ""periodic copy"" backup copy job, B. A single ""immediate copy"" backup copy job, C. Two ""immediate copy"" backup copy jobs, D. Two ""periodic copy"" backup copy jobs";B;N/A;Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf;According to the Veeam Backup & Replication best practice guide, a new copy job mode was added called immediate copy. This mode immediately starts the backup copy job as soon as restore points appear in the repository. It also provides the ability to copy SQL and Oracle log backups which is not possible with traditional periodic backup copy. Therefore, if you want to create a secondary copy of all the backups including transaction logs, you should use an immediate copy backup copy job. The simplest configuration would be a single immediate copy backup copy job for all workloads (option B).
A Veeam administrator is creating a protection group that needs to back up all servers for the accounting department using Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.

A daily backup job for seven Hyper-V VMs has been configured at the main site, keeping 14 days' worth of backup files. They want to get a copy of the VM backups to a repository at the disaster recovery site. They want to keep six months' worth of backup files at the disaster recovery site. They also need to be able to restore the VMs to any given day within two months and any given week within six months. How should a backup copy job be configured to meet these requirements?;A. Use periodic copy (pruning) mode, keeping 180 days of retention., B. Use immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points., C. Use periodic copy (pruning) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and six monthly GFS restore points., D. Use immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 180 days of retention.;B;N/A;Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf;According to the Veeam Backup & Replication user guide, you can use a long-term retention policy (GFS) to keep backup files for longer periods of time. GFS stands for grandfather-father-son and refers to a backup rotation scheme that allows you to create weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly restore points. Therefore, if you want to be able to restore the VMs to any given day within two months and any given week within six months, you should use a GFS policy with 62 days of retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points. The simplest configuration would be an immediate copy (mirroring) mode with these settings (option B).
A company needs several VMware thick provisioned VMs restored. The physical proxies used for restoration have access to the Fibre Channel datastores used by VMware. Which transport mode will be used by default to restore these VMs?;A. Network mode, B. Virtual appliance, C. Quick Migration, D.

A director in a business needs a folder of traffic photos restored from a Linux server. This machine sits on a VM backed up by Veeam Backup & Replication. The director wants the files restored to their original location and does not want to lose the original files. What functionality will be used to restore the folder using the Veeam Guest OS restoration wizard?;"A. Restore the files using the ""Versioning"" function. Files will be prefixed with numbers (1-, 2-, 3-, etc.)., B. Restore the files using the ""Overwrite"" function. Original files will be renamed., C. Restore the files using the ""Hold"" function. The director can then determine the status of the original and restored files., D. Restore the files using the ""Keep"" function. Original files will be untouched";D;N/A;Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf;According to the Veeam Backup & Replication user guide, you can use the Guest File Restore wizard to restore files and folders from VM guest OSes that run Linux or other non-Windows OSes. The wizard allows you to choose how to handle situations when restored files already exist on the target location. Therefore, if you want to restore the folder of traffic photos to their original location and do not want to lose the original files, you should use the Keep function. This function will preserve original files on disk and will not overwrite them with restored files.
15 VMs are running on a Hyper-V platform and five physical servers at a remote office (ROBO). The administrator has been tasked with setting up centralized off-site backups at the headquarters (HQ). The available bandwidth is 50 Mbps. RPO is set to six hours and the data generated for the interval is 500 GB. WAN accelerators can be added if necessary. Which of the following will achieve the RPO?;"A. Use backup copy jobs in with High-Performance Mode enabled. Set the schedule to run every six hours., B. Use backup copy jobs with copy mode set to ""immediate copy"". Use WAN acceleration., C. Use backup copy jobs with copy mode set to ""periodic copy"" and copy every six hours., D. Configure the backup copy jobs with traffic throttling to 30 Mbps to limit the impact. Enable WAN acceleration.";B;N/A;Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf;According to the Veeam Backup & Replication user guide, WAN acceleration is a technology that optimizes data transfer to remote locations by performing deduplication and caching. It is specific for off-site backup copy jobs and replication jobs. Therefore, if you want to achieve the RPO of six hours with 500 GB of data and 50 Mbps of bandwidth, you should use backup copy jobs with WAN acceleration enabled. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and speed up the backup process. The simplest configuration would be an immediate copy mode with WAN acceleration.
A file on a Windows VM hosted on vSphere is corrupted and must be restored. VMware tools are installed and up to date on the VM.

Run Veeam file restore wizard and let it restore through VIX., B. Start an Instant VM Recovery session and log on into the restored image to copy/paste the file to restore., C. It is impossible to restore the file on the VM if the mount server cannot reach it through the network., D. Run Veeam file restore wizard and use the ""copy to"" to download the file locally in a shared folder.";A;N/A;Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf;According to the Veeam Backup & Replication user guide, you can use the File Level Restore wizard to restore files and folders from VM guest OSes that run Windows. The wizard allows you to choose how to access the VM guest OS: through network or through VIX. VIX is a VMware API that enables programmatic access to virtual machine operations. Therefore, if you want to restore a file on a Windows VM hosted on vSphere and the mount server cannot connect to the VM through the network, you can use VIX as an alternative method of access. This will allow you to restore the file directly to its original location without downloading it locally or starting an Instant VM Recovery session.
A planned failover of three VMs has just completed successfully, starting the VMs at the disaster recovery location. What next actions are available for the failover plan?;A. Undo, Start, Copy, Delete, B. Cancel, Start, Edit, Delete, C. Cancel, Start, Copy, Delete, D. Undo, Start, Edit, Delete;D;N/A;Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf;According to the Veeam Backup & Replication user guide, a failover plan is a set of rules that defines how VMs must be failed over to their replicas. You can create and run failover plans for regular replicas and CDP replicas. After you run a failover plan, you can perform the following actions on it: Undo reverts VMs in the failover plan back to their original state at the production site. Start - runs the failover plan again if you need to repeat the failover operation for some reason. Edit- modifies the settings of the failover plan, such as adding or removing VMs, changing their order or time delay. Delete - removes the failover plan from Veeam Backup & Replication. This does not affect the VM replicas that are used by the plan.
There is a company-wide mandate to migrate operations off corporate datacenters and over to AWS, Azure, and GCE. The Veeam engineer has backups of VMware, Hyper-V, and Nutanix VMs stored in on-premises repositories. The performance of a test restore was not satisfactory. Which solution should the engineer deploy?;A- Caching servers on premises and in the cloud, B- Veeam Wan Accelerators on premises and in the clouds, C- Upgraded bandwidth to the Internet, D- Helper appliance in the cloud;B;N/A;veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-copeland-24-01-2024-10qa-certscare.pdf;To improve the performance of test restores from on-premises repositories to cloud environments (AWS, Azure, and GCE), deploying Veeam WAN Accelerators on premises and in the cloud is recommended. WAN Accelerators optimize data transfer over the network, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred and thereby improving restore performance.

A Veeam proxy server is configured as follows. No modifications are allowed to the transport mode. [image] When performing a restore of a VMware virtual disk using this proxy server, the restore fails. What is a possible cause?;A- CBT is enabled on the virtual disk., B- CBT is disabled on the virtual disk., C- The virtual disk is thin-provisioned., D- The virtual disk is thick-provisioned;C;N/A;veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-copeland-24-01-2024-10qa-certscare.pdf;Given the provided transport modes and the fact that no modifications are allowed to these settings, a possible cause for the restore of a VMware virtual disk to fail using this proxy server is C: The virtual disk is thin-provisioned. In the transport modes shown, the Direct storage access and Virtual appliance options would require the VM disk files to be accessible in a certain way that might not be compatible with thin-provisioned disks depending on the storage configuration and the current state of the VM. If the storage integration specifics or the snapshot handling do not support the thin-provisioned format, the restore operation could fail. It's important to ensure that the transport mode selected is compatible with the type of virtual disk being restored to prevent such issues.
A Microsoft SQL server is running in a VMware VM. The VM is very sensitive to snapshots, and can only be snapshotted once per day at 3 AM. However, the RPO for the databases running inside the VM is 1 hour. Which two Application-Aware Processing Settings should be selected in the backup job so that the 1 hour RPO for the databases is met? (Choose two.);A- SQL Tab: Choose how this job should process Microsoft SQL Server Transaction Logs: Back up logs periodically, B- SQL Tab: Choose how this job should process Microsoft SQL Server Transaction Logs: Do not truncate logs, C- General Tab: VSS Settings: Perform copy only, D- SQL Tab: Choose how this job should process Microsoft SQL Server Transaction Logs: Truncate Logs, E- General Tab: VSS Settings: Process transaction logs with this job;A, E;N/A;veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-copeland-24-01-2024-10qa-certscare.pdf;To meet the 1-hour RPO for the databases within the VM, while only being able to snapshot the VM once per day, the best strategy is to enable regular transaction log backups (option A) and process transaction logs with the job (option E). This setup allows the system to capture changes in the SQL Server transaction logs at intervals less than the RPO requirement, without needing to snapshot the entire VM more frequently.

The configuration database is corrupted, and the backup administrator wants to recover the data. Which configuration restore mode should be used?;A- Instant Recovery, B- Restore, C- Failover, D- Migrate;B;N/A;veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-copeland-24-01-2024-10qa-certscare.pdf;In the event that the Veeam Backup & Replication configuration database is corrupted, the appropriate action to take is to perform a configuration restore. Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to back up and restore its configuration database. The Restore option should be used to recover the data from a configuration backup. This process will restore the configuration database from the backup file, which includes information about backup jobs, repository settings, and more. Instant Recovery, Failover, and Migrate are not appropriate options for recovering a corrupted configuration database. Instant Recovery is used to quickly restore a VM to a running state, Failover is used for High Availability in case a VM fails, and Migrate is used to move VMs from one host or storage to another.

A backup administrator is called in to review a new Veeam deployment created by a coworker. The backup administrator takes the following notes: * 12 backup jobs * 1 SOBR configured with AWS S3 Performance Tier * 1 Repository configured on Hardened Immutable Repository The administrator also notes that six jobs are configured to use the SOBR and six jobs are configured to use the Hardened Immutable Repository. What should the backup administrator report to the other coworker regarding the 3-2-1 backup strategy?;A- This will save costs with the Archive Tier in the SOBR., B- This needs the Hardened Immutable Repository added to the capacity tier., C- This only has 1 copy of the backup data., D- This meets the 3-2-1 best practices requirements.;C;N/A;veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-copeland-24-01-2024-10qa-certscare.pdf;The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a best practice that suggests having three total copies of your data, two of which are local but on different devices or media, and one copy offsite. In the described scenario, although there is an offsite component (SOBR with AWS S3 Performance Tier), and a local hardened immutable repository, there is no indication of a second local copy on a different device or media. This means that there is only one local copy of the backup data and one offsite copy. Therefore, the setup does not meet the 3-2-1 best practices requirement, which would involve having at least one more local copy on different media or device.

What is the primary benefit of configuring replica mapping?;A- Compressed WAN traffic, B- Deduplicated WAN traffic, C- Reduced WAN traffic, D- Encrypted WAN traffic;C;N/A;veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-mays-09-08-2024-7qa-dumpssheet.pdf;The primary benefit of configuring replica mapping in Veeam Backup & Replication is C: Reduced WAN traffic. Replica mapping is a feature that allows an administrator to map an existing VM in the disaster recovery site to a replica job. This is particularly useful when the initial replication of a large VM has been performed by other means (such as shipping a hard drive with the VM data to the DR site) or if a replica VM already exists and needs to be re-synced with the source VM. By using replica mapping, Veeam can avoid transferring the entire VM over the WAN again and instead only synchronize the differences between the source VM and the existing replica. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the WAN, conserving bandwidth and speeding up the replication process. It's an efficient way to manage replicas, especially for large VMs or in environments with limited bandwidth.
