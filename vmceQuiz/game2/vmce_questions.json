    "question": "To be able to increase backup retention, the company has bought a Data Domain deduplication appliance. After setting up the jobs to use it, the backup administrator observes an increase of resource consumption on the backup server. The proxy configuration has not been modified. What is causing the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A- The backup appliance does not have enough resources to process the data",
      "B- The SSL certificate on the backup appliance needs to be updated",
      "C- The backup server has to fulfill the gateway role",
      "D- The backup server needs additional resources to use a deduplication appliance"
    ],
    "correct": [
      "C"
    ],
    "explanation": "When integrating a Data Domain deduplication appliance with Veeam Backup & Replication, it is typically used as a backup repository. The backup server may need to take on the gateway role, especially if the Data Domain is integrated over NFS or CIFS. This means that the backup server will be responsible for processing the data flow between the Veeam proxies and the deduplication appliance. If the gateway server (backup server) is not well-resourced, this additional workload can cause an increase in resource consumption on the backup server. The appliance's resources and the SSL certificate are not related to increased resource consumption on the backup server, and simply needing additional resources for deduplication (D) is not specific enough without indicating the gateway role."

    "correct": [
      "A"
    ],
    "explanation": "After using Instant VM Recovery to bring a critical crashed server back online quickly, the final step required to complete the recovery process is A: Migrate to production. Instant VM Recovery allows a VM to run directly from the backup file in a temporary location, enabling rapid recovery and minimal downtime. However, because the VM is running in this provisional state, it's essential to migrate it back to the production environment to ensure long-term stability and performance. The 'Migrate to production' operation involves moving the running VM from the backup storage to the production storage, typically involving a storage vMotion in VMware environments or a similar process in other hypervisors. This step ensures that the VM is fully restored to its original or a new production environment, solidifying the recovery and allowing the VM to operate as part of the normal infrastructure once again."

    "explanation": "Instant VM Recovery is a feature in Veeam that allows you to start a virtual machine directly from a backup file without waiting for the full restore. Using Instant VM Recovery to Hyper-V is the best option for achieving the lowest possible Recovery Time Objective (RTO) because it allows the damaged physical server's backup to be run as a VM in the Hyper-V environment almost immediately. The Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows supports Instant Recovery to a Hyper-V VM, which will enable you to restore service quickly while you can plan for a more permanent recovery solution."

      "D- This meets the 3-2-1 best practices requirements"
    ],
    "correct": [
      "C"
    ],
    "explanation": "The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a best practice that suggests having three total copies of your data, two of which are local but on different devices or media, and one copy offsite. In the described scenario, although there is an offsite component (SOBR with AWS S3 Performance Tier), and a local hardened immutable repository, there is no indication of a second local copy on a different device or media. This means that there is only one local copy of the backup data and one offsite copy. Therefore, the setup does not meet the 3-2-1 best practices requirement, which would involve having at least one more local copy on different media or device."
