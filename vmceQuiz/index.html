                explanation: "To meet the 1-hour RPO for the databases within the VM, while only being able to snapshot the VM once per day, the best strategy is to enable regular transaction log backups (option A) and process transaction logs with the job (option E). This setup allows the system to capture changes in the SQL Server transaction logs at intervals less than the RPO requirement, without needing to snapshot the entire VM more frequently.

                answer: "The backup server has to fulfill the gateway role.",
                explanation: "When integrating a Data Domain deduplication appliance, the backup server may need to take on the gateway role, especially if integrated over NFS or CIFS. This additional workload can increase resource consumption on the backup server if it's not well-resourced."
