                question: "After using Instant VM Recovery to bring a critical crashed server back online quickly, what else is required to complete the recovery?",
                options: [
                    "Migrate to production",
                    "Commit failover",

                question: "Why is it recommended to install Veeam ONE before Veeam Backup & Replication?",
                options: [
                    "Veeam ONE stores the license file necessary for Veeam Backup & Replication.",
                    "Veeam ONE can verify that the server meets the minimum requirements to install Veeam Backup & Replication.",

                question: "A backup administrator reviews a new deployment with 12 backup jobs, 1 SOBR with AWS S3 Performance Tier, and 1 Hardened Immutable Repository. Six jobs use the SOBR, and six use the Hardened Immutable Repository. What should the administrator report regarding the 3-2-1 backup strategy?",
                options: [
                    "This will save costs with the Archive Tier in the SOBR.",
                    "This needs the Hardened Immutable Repository added to the capacity tier.",
                    "This only has 1 copy of the backup data.",
                    "This meets the 3-2-1 best practices requirements."
                ],
                answer: "This only has 1 copy of the backup data.",
                explanation: "The 3-2-1 strategy requires three copies of data, two local on different media/devices, and one offsite. The scenario describes one local copy (Hardened Immutable Repository) and one offsite component (SOBR with AWS S3). It lacks a second local copy on different media, thus only having 1 copy of the backup data locally does not meet the 3-2-1 best practices."

                    "Virtual Lab",
                    "Staged Restore",
                    "Secure Restore"
                ],
                answer: "Application Group",
                explanation: "An Application Group in SureBackup allows you to define a group of interdependent VMs (like mission-critical applications) that should be started together in a specific order within the isolated Virtual Lab environment for verification and testing."

                ],
                answer: "Use Instant VM Recovery to Hyper-V.",
                explanation: "Instant VM Recovery to Hyper-V allows the damaged physical server's backup to be run as a VM in the Hyper-V environment almost immediately, providing the lowest Recovery Time Objective (RTO)."

                 // Note: The original document lists A and E as correct. We need to handle multiple correct answers for this question type.
                answer: ["SQL Tab: Choose how this job should process Microsoft SQL Server Transaction Logs: Back up logs periodically", "General Tab: VSS Settings: Process transaction logs with this job"],
                explanation: "To meet the 1-hour RPO without frequent VM snapshots, enable periodic transaction log backups (Option A) and process transaction logs with the job (Option E). This captures changes more frequently than the daily snapshot."

                question: "To solve a space issue while enabling GFS retention, after adding a NAS repository to SOBR as Performance Tier, which option should the engineer choose?",
                options: [
                    "Add an Object Storage as Capacity tier and set the policy to copy backups to object storage as soon as they are created",
                    "Add another NAS repository as Capacity tier and set the policy to move backups older than 14 days",
                    "Add an Object Storage as Archive tier and set the policy to move all GFS backups",
                    "Add an Object Storage as Capacity tier and set the policy to move backups older than 14 days"
                ],
                answer: "Add an Object Storage as Capacity tier and set the policy to move backups older than 14 days",
                explanation: "Adding Object Storage as a Capacity tier to the SOBR allows moving older backups (older than 14 days in this scenario) off the local NAS, freeing up space for daily backups while leveraging cost-effective object storage for long-term GFS retention."

                question: "A daily backup job for seven Hyper-V VMs keeps 14 days of backups. A copy is needed at a DR site, keeping six months of backups, restorable to any day within two months and any week within six months. How should a backup copy job be configured?",
                options: [
                    "Use periodic copy (pruning) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and six monthly GFS restore points.",
                    "Use immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 180 days of retention.",
                    "Use periodic copy (pruning) mode, keeping 180 days of retention.",
                    "Use immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points."
                ],
                 // Note: The original document for this question in certsdeals-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-dumps-by-lambert-15-04-2024-10qa.pdf says A is correct, but the explanation points to B. The sample-questions-for-veeam-vmce-v12-exam-by-price.pdf and veeam-vmce-v12-dumps-by-copeland-24-01-2024-10qa-certscare.pdf also have this question and say A is correct with the same explanation. The Veeam Certified Engineer v12 VMCE_v12 Dumps.pdf has a similar question (Q6) and says B is correct with a detailed explanation supporting GFS for weekly/monthly retention. Given the requirement for weekly retention within the six months, option B which explicitly mentions 26 weekly GFS restore points seems more accurate to the requirement than option A which only mentions monthly GFS. I will use B as the correct answer and adapt the explanation slightly to fit the question's specifics regarding daily/weekly restore points. Let's re-evaluate the question and options carefully. The requirement is daily within 2 months (approx 60 days) and weekly within 6 months (approx 26 weeks).
                 // Option A: periodic copy (pruning) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and six monthly GFS. This meets daily for 62 days and monthly GFS, but not *weekly* within 6 months.
                 // Option B: immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points. This meets daily for 62 days and *weekly* for 26 weeks (approx 6 months). Immediate copy mode is also suitable for transferring backups as soon as they are created.
                 // Option C: periodic copy (pruning) mode, keeping 180 days of retention. This meets daily for ~6 months but no specific weekly/monthly GFS points mentioned.
                 // Option D: immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points. This is the same as B.
                 // It seems there might be conflicting answers/explanations across the documents. Based on the requirement for *weekly* restore points within 6 months, option B/D is the most fitting as it explicitly mentions weekly GFS. I will use B as the correct answer and explanation.
                answer: "Use immediate copy (mirroring) mode, keeping 62 days of retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points.",
                explanation: "To meet the requirements of daily restore points for two months (62 days) and weekly restore points for six months (26 weeks), the immediate copy mode with 62 days retention and 26 weekly GFS restore points is the correct configuration. Immediate copy ensures backups are copied promptly, and GFS handles the long-term weekly retention."
